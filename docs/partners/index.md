## What is a DSPLAY Partner?

A **DSPLAY Partner** is a special kind of customer which can have other customers (children) under its account.

The partner account has admin-like privileges over its children accounts. It can:
- Set the maximum allowed terminals of its children
- Enable/disable child accounts
- Manage users in its children account
- Has its own registration page for customers

> Partners accounts are charged by the total of active terminals, QR Codes and any other kind of billed resource used by their children.

>DSPLAY doesn't impose any restrictions on the partners pricing model.
